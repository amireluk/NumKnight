# NumKnight — Dev Notes for Claude

## Dev environment

Running inside a **VS Code Dev Container** (Ubuntu 24.04, Node 20, GitHub CLI).

### Container config (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)
- `"runArgs": ["--privileged"]` — required so Chrome's internal sandbox can create Linux namespaces (without this, Playwright crashes)
- `postCreateCommand` auto-runs on rebuild: installs Claude Code + `playwright-mcp` globally, `npm install`, and `npx playwright install chrome`
- Mounts `~/.claude` from the Windows host so credentials and memory persist across container rebuilds

### Playwright MCP (`.mcp.json`)
- `playwright-mcp` is configured as an MCP server — use it to visually test the game
- Dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173/NumKnight/` — always start with `npm run dev` before using Playwright
- No `--no-sandbox` needed — `--privileged` on the container handles it
- The `.playwright-mcp/` directory (screenshots/logs) is **not committed** — add to `.gitignore` if needed

### Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
- `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` — auto-approves the Playwright MCP
- Common npm scripts and git commands are pre-allowed (no confirmation prompts)

---

## Sprite processing pipeline
See `prompts/pipeline.md` for the full Python pipeline (split → chroma-key → binarize → erode → autocrop → normalize → save).
Per-character settings (bg colour, flip_poses, green_bg) are documented in that file.

---

## ⚠️ Always bump the version after making changes
The version lives in `package.json` → `"version"` field (patch digit = third number).
Increment it at the end of every session that changes code.
`npm run build` bumps it automatically via `scripts/bump-version.js`.
If the user is only running `npm run dev`, update `package.json` manually.

---

## Deploying

There are two deployments. All code lives on `main` — no separate source branch.

| Command | URL | When to use |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `npm run deploy:dev` | `https://amireluk.github.io/NumKnight/dev/` | Test changes |
| `npm run deploy` | `https://amireluk.github.io/NumKnight/` | Stable release |

> ⚠️ Running `npm run deploy` (prod) will overwrite the `/dev/` subfolder. Run `deploy:dev` again afterwards if needed.

### Deploy + push sequence (ALWAYS follow this order)

**Deploy to dev:**
```
npm run deploy:dev                        # bumps version, builds, deploys
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.X.X"
git tag deploy-dev-vX.X.X
git push origin main --tags
```

**Deploy to prod:**
```
npm run deploy                            # bumps version, builds, deploys
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.X.X"
git tag deploy-prod-vX.X.X
git push origin main --tags
```

Deploy FIRST (the deploy script bumps the version), THEN commit + tag + push so the bumped version is persisted in git.

---

## ⚠️ After every session that changes code — ALWAYS ask the user:
1. **"Deploy to dev?"** — if yes, follow the deploy-to-dev sequence above
2. **"Push to GitHub?"** — if yes, commit any unstaged changes, then push

Do NOT deploy to prod unless the user explicitly asks.

## Campaign design principles

- **Player HP is always 3** across all difficulties — hardcoded constant, not in config.
  Difficulty is expressed through `enemyDamage` (how much each wrong answer costs), not by giving the player fewer HP.
- **Enemy HP stays low** (max 5) — individual fights should feel snappy. Challenge comes from question difficulty, timers, and damage, not grinding.
- **Battle count ramps up** within each difficulty as the campaign progresses. Early worlds are quick introductions; late worlds feel like sieges.
- **Easy** uses only the easy-pattern tables (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s). No timers. One battle per world — a confidence-building tour.
- **Medium** strips 2s from the multiplier pool, expands world by world toward the full 10×10 board, and introduces timers in the last two worlds. The final enemy deals 2 damage (one mistake = death).
- **Hard** strips 1s, 2s, and 10s quickly (gone from Swamp onward). Timers from Swamp onward. Damage escalates — Castle enemy deals 2, Dragon deals 3 (instant death on any mistake).
- **factorRange is always [1, 10]** — the right-hand factor is never restricted. Difficulty comes entirely from which left-hand `multipliers` are active.
- `enemyDamage` defaults to 1 if omitted. Only set it explicitly when it's > 1.

---

## Campaign config (`campaign.config.js`)

Three named configs — `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD` — are exported. The active config is determined at runtime by the difficulty the player picks on `StartScreen`. Each world entry shape:

```js
{
  id, name, icon,
  battles,       // number of fights in this world
  playerHP,      // hits before death (3 = gold/silver/bronze possible)
  enemy: { id, name, hp },   // id: goblin|skeleton|orc|darkKnight|dragon
  timer,         // null = unlimited | N = N seconds/question (miss = damage)
  multipliers,   // times-tables for left factor  a × b
  factorRange,   // [min, max] for right factor
}
```

---

## World table (Medium difficulty)

| # | World | Enemy | HP | Timer | Multipliers |
|---|-------|-------|----|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Forest 🌲 | Goblin | 4 | — | 2,3,4 |
| 1 | Swamp 🌿 | Skeleton | 5 | — | 2–6 |
| 2 | Mountains ⛰️ | Orc | 6 | — | 3–8 |
| 3 | Castle 🏰 | Dark Knight | 6 | 8s | full 1–10 |
| 4 | Dragon Lair 🐉 | Dragon | 7 | 5s | 3–9 |

Easy: 1 battle/world, hp:1, no timers — good for quick testing.
Hard: tighter timers (Castle 6s, Dragon Lair 4s), Dragon Lair playerHP:2.

---

## Architecture

### Run state (localStorage key: `numknight_run`)
```js
{
  worldIndex,
  battleIndex,
  trophies[],      // 'gold'|'silver'|'bronze' — one per completed battle
  totalScore,      // cumulative score across all battles
  worldScores[],   // score per world (indexed by worldIndex)
}
```
- Victory when `trophies.length >= sum of all worlds' battles`
- Death (playerHP → 0) → game over → leaderboard → restart

### Trophy logic
- 0 mistakes → gold, 1 → silver, 2 → bronze, 3 hits → dead

### Scoring
```
battleScore = calcBattleScore(trophy, timeBonus)
  trophy multiplier: gold×3, silver×2, bronze×1
  timeBonus: only for timed worlds — floor((timeLeft / world.timer) × 50) per correct answer
```

### Multiplier system
- Each world has an explicit `multipliers` array in the config
- `makeRound(multipliers, factorRange)` picks `a` from the array, `b` from factorRange

### Timer mechanic (Castle / Dragon Lair)
- Countdown starts after intro; resets on each new round
- Expiry = wrong answer (highlights correct button, deals damage)
- Visual: draining bar green→amber→red + seconds label inside problem card

### i18n
- `src/game/i18n.js` exports `T` (translation map) and `LANG_KEY` (localStorage key)
- `lang` state lives in `App.jsx`, passed as `lang` + `t` props to all screens
- Screens apply `dir="rtl"` when `lang === 'he'`
- Toggle on `StartScreen` (EN / עב)

### Screen flow
```
start → map → battle → result (won)  → next battle OR cleared → map / leaderboard (victory)
                     → result (lost) → leaderboard → start
```

---

## Enemy SVGs (`EnemyCharacter.jsx`)

Each enemy: `BodySVG` + `WeaponArmSVG` (same `viewBox="0 0 90 120"`, overlaid).
Rendered at 84×112 px, mirrored with `scaleX(-1)`.
Weapon arm pivot: `transformOrigin: '66px 50px'` (shoulder — same for all).

| Enemy | Weapon | Splash colour |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Goblin | Club | `#fbbf24` |
| Skeleton | Scythe | `#a78bfa` |
| Orc | Axe | `#fb923c` |
| Dark Knight | Sword | `#94a3b8` |
| Dragon | Claw + fire | `#f87171` |

---

## BattleBackground layers
1. **Sky** — CSS `linear-gradient` div (`inset: 0`) — never clipped
2. **Sun** — CSS absolute div pinned `top:18 right:18`, 64px glow + 40px core
3. **Hills** — SVG `position:absolute bottom:0 height:48%` with `overflow="visible"` so crests render into sky; `preserveAspectRatio="none"` stretches to fill width

The arena div has **no** `overflow:hidden` so weapon/wing sprites aren't clipped.

### Raster background images (`public/assets/backgrounds/*.webp`)
- All 5 backgrounds are **landscape** (wider than tall) — intentionally wider than any phone screen
- Rendered with `objectFit: cover` + `objectPosition: center center` inside a portrait container
- This means the **height always fills the screen** and the left/right edges are cropped
- Wider source image = more cropping on narrow phones; narrower = less padding on wide tablets
- **Recommended generation size: 4:3 landscape** (e.g. 1600×1200) — wide enough to cover tablet widths without wasting too much on sides
- Center-dense composition is critical: key visuals must be in the **central ~50%** of the image width since the sides will be cropped on most phones
- Ground line should sit at ~55–62% from top so character torsos read against terrain, not sky
- See `prompts/backgrounds.md` for AI generation prompts

---

## UI details
- Version label + `debug`/`prod` mode shown top-left of the skybox (in BattleScreen)
- Encounter dots: outlined SVG circles (○) that fill gold (●) as battles complete; active battle has a centre dot
- Result screen: `CONTINUE →` button, dots use same outlined→filled style, `battleNum/totalBattles` is dynamic

---

## What was last worked on
- **Practice mode** — full implementation (picker → battle → end screen)
- UI polish: button styles, Hebrew exclamation marks, progress bar, praise popups
- Options + picker screens: kingdom scenery (castle, knight, birds)
- **Phase 7 (Statistics)** — designed and documented, not yet implemented

## Implementation status
- **Phases 1–4** (World Map, Backgrounds, Scoring, Leaderboard): ✅ Complete
- **Practice Mode**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 5** (Visual Polish): ⏳ Pending
- **Phase 6** (Backend Leaderboard): ⏳ Pending
- **Phase 7** (Per-Number Statistics): ⏳ Pending — full spec in `PLAN_PENDING.md`

---

## Practice mode

### Screen flow
```
start → practice-picker → practice-battle → practice-end
                ↑               ↑ (quit)         |
                └───────────────┴─────────────────┘
```
- Quit (✕ or back) from practice-battle → goes to **start screen** (not picker)
- "Practice Again" from end screen → same numbers, new battle
- "Change Numbers" → back to picker

### Number picker
- Grid 1–9 (3×3), max 4 selected
- Tapping a 5th number shakes it and does nothing
- No count indicator shown
- Selected state: solid yellow fill + dark text (same as main action buttons)
- Background: kingdom scenery (castle, strolling knight, birds)

### Practice battle
- Background: castle (`worldId='castle'`)
- Enemy: second `KnightCharacter` with `grayscale(1) brightness(0.55)` CSS filter — placeholder until real dummy art
- No HP bars, no timer
- Wrong answer: flash animation plays, question **stays** (player tries again)
- Score = number of questions answered correctly **on the first attempt**
- Progress bar: thin yellow bar (`#fbbf24`) at bottom of arena, fills left→right (`dir="ltr"` forced), no initial animation
- Praise popup: random text rises from between the knights after each correct answer
  - EN: GREAT! / GOOD JOB! / AWESOME! / CORRECT! / NICE ONE!
  - HE: מעולה! / כל הכבוד! / נהדר! / נכון! / יפה מאוד!
- Top header shows "PRACTICE" label + selected numbers (e.g. `3 · 7 · 8`)
- No BattleIntro

### Practice end screen
- Background: kingdom scenery (castle, strolling knight, birds) — same as title/options/picker
- Score shown as sentence: "You got X out of 20 right" (no raw fraction)
- Both buttons solid yellow

### Consecutive question prevention
`makeRound(multipliers, factorRange, lastProblem)` retries up to 6 times if the new problem matches the last (in either factor order). Applied in both campaign (`BattleScreen`) and practice.

---

## UI design rules (established)

- **All screen buttons** are solid yellow (`bg-yellow-400 border-b-4 border-yellow-600 text-black`) — no translucent/ghost buttons in the main UI
- **Selected state** (toggles, number grid): solid yellow fill + dark text + bottom shadow — same weight as action buttons. Unselected: dark semi-transparent (`rgba(0,0,0,0.35)`) + white border.
- **Hebrew exclamation marks**: always placed at the **end** of the string (`מעולה!` not `!מעולה`)
- **Global `user-select: none`** on all `button` and `a` elements (prevents Android long-press text selection)
- **Screens with kingdom scenery** (title, options, practice picker, practice end): `KingdomBackground` + `StrollingKnight` + `KingdomForeground` + `FlyingCreatures`, content at `zIndex: 4` to clear foreground (z=3)

# ROADMAP

> Phases 1–4 are **complete**. See PROGRESS.md for details.
> Phases 5–6 are pending. See PLAN.md and PLAN_PENDING.md.

## Phase 1 — World Map Screen ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Show the player where they are in the campaign between battles.

### What it looks like
- A vertical or winding path with 5 world nodes (icon + name)
- Completed nodes show the best trophy earned across their battles
- Current world node pulses / is highlighted
- Future nodes are locked/dimmed
- Shown after the result screen when advancing to a new world (not between battles in the same world)
- A "FIGHT" button at the current node launches the next battle

### Technical approach
- New screen: `src/screens/WorldMapScreen.jsx`
- New App screen state: `'map'` — inserted between `result` (last battle of a world) and `battle` (first of next world)
- Props needed: `worlds` (WORLDS array), `worldIndex` (current), `trophies[]` (all earned so far)
- Trophy per world = best trophy across that world's completed battles (gold > silver > bronze)
- Framer Motion: staggered node entrance, path draw animation (`pathLength` 0→1)

### Data shape addition to runState (no breaking change)
- Trophies array is already stored; derive per-world best at render time

---

## Phase 2 — Per-World Backgrounds ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Each region feels visually distinct.

### Palette plan
| World | Sky | Ground/terrain | Special elements |
|-------|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| Forest | Blue→light blue (current) | Green hills (current) | Sun |
| Swamp | Murky purple-green→grey-green | Dark boggy ground, dead trees | Dim moon |
| Mountains | Cold grey-blue→pale | Rocky grey ground, snow patches | Snow-capped peaks |
| Castle | Dark navy→charcoal | Stone floor, battlements silhouette | Storm clouds |
| Dragon Lair | Deep red-orange→dark | Volcanic rock, lava cracks | Glowing lava glow at bottom |

### Technical approach
- `BattleBackground` accepts a `worldId` prop
- Internal switch/map returns the right layer config (sky gradient stops, ground colour, extra SVG elements)
- Sun becomes a world-specific light source (sun for forest/mountains, moon for swamp, no sun for castle/lair)
- Add `background` field to `campaign.config.js` world entries (or derive from `id` — simpler)
- No new files needed; all within `BattleBackground.jsx`

---

## Phase 3 — Scoring System ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Give players a numeric score to chase, rewarding speed and accuracy.

### Score formula (per battle)
```
battleScore = basePoints × trophyMultiplier + timeBonus

basePoints       = enemy.hp × 100          (harder enemies = more base points)
trophyMultiplier = gold:3  silver:2  bronze:1
timeBonus        = only for timed worlds (timer !== null)
                 = sum over all questions of: floor((timeLeft / world.timer) × 50)
                   (answered with 8s left on an 8s timer = 50 bonus pts)
```

### Run score
`totalScore = sum of all battleScores`

### What needs tracking
- `questionTimeLeft` at moment of correct answer — already available in BattleScreen state
- Pass `score` out of `onBattleEnd({ won, mistakes, score })`
- Store per-battle scores in `runState.trophies` → extend to `runState.battles[]`:
  ```js
  battles: [{ trophy, score, worldIndex, battleIndex }]
  ```
- Show battle score on the result screen (animates up like a counter)
- Show cumulative run score on the victory screen

### Changes needed
- `battleLogic.js`: add `calcBattleScore(enemyHp, trophy, timeBonuses)`
- `BattleScreen.jsx`: track `timeBonuses[]`, pass score to `onBattleEnd`
- `ResultScreen.jsx`: display battle score + running total
- `runState.js`: extend battles array shape

---

## Phase 4 — Local Leaderboard ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Top runs stored in the browser, shown after each completed run.

### Data (localStorage key: `numknight_scores`)
```js
[
  { name, totalScore, worldsCleared, date, trophySummary },
  // kept sorted, capped at top 10
]
```

### Flow
1. Victory screen: show final score + prompt for player name (simple text input)
2. Save entry to `numknight_scores`
3. Transition to leaderboard screen showing top 10
4. "PLAY AGAIN" from leaderboard restarts

### New files
- `src/game/scoreState.js` — `saveScore(entry)`, `loadScores()`, `clearScores()`
- `src/screens/LeaderboardScreen.jsx` — ranked table with trophy icons, score, name, date
- `src/screens/NameEntryScreen.jsx` — simple input + confirm (or inline on victory screen)

### UI
- Gold/silver/bronze row tinting based on avg trophy
- Animated rank numbers counting in
- Player's just-submitted run highlighted

---

## Phase 5 — Visual Polish ⏳ PENDING
**Goal:** Juice up the moments that matter most.

### Priority list
1. **Enemy death animation** — when enemy HP hits 0: rotate + fall off-screen (translateY +200, rotate 90deg, fade out). Currently enemy just disappears when `won` phase starts.
2. **Player death animation** — knight topples/falls when HP hits 0 (similar fall + fade)
3. **Screen flash on hit** — brief red overlay (opacity 0→0.3→0) when player takes damage
4. **Victory particle burst** — confetti/star particles explode on gold trophy
5. **World transition** — cinematic wipe or flash between worlds on the map
6. **Answer button shake** — wrong answer: button shakes left-right
7. **HP bar animate** — smooth lerp instead of instant drop; flash red on damage
8. **Idle enemy variety** — enemies do occasional random actions (scratch head, look around) during long idle

### Technical notes
- Enemy fall: add `'dying'` phase to EnemyCharacter, triggered when `phase === 'won'` and `enemyHP === 0`; use Framer Motion exit animation
- Player fall: same in KnightCharacter
- Screen flash: absolute overlay div in BattleScreen, `AnimatePresence` + opacity keyframe
- Particles: can use a simple hand-rolled CSS/SVG burst (no library needed) similar to the existing `HitSplash`

---

## Phase 6 — Cross-Device Backend Leaderboard ⏳ PENDING
**Goal:** Global high scores visible across all devices/players.

### Stack
**Firebase + Firestore** (Google, free tier)
- Firestore NoSQL database — simple document reads/writes, no SQL needed
- Firebase Analytics (GA4) included in the same project — see Phase GA
- Security via Firestore Security Rules (not key secrecy — the API key is intentionally public)
- `firebase` npm package, ~40KB gzipped

### Firestore collection: `scores`
Each document: `{ name, totalScore, worldsCleared, difficulty, date }`

### Security rules
```
allow read: if true;
allow create: if request.resource.data.keys()
  .hasOnly(['name','totalScore','worldsCleared','difficulty','date']);
allow update, delete: if false;
```

### App changes
- `src/game/firebase.js` — init app, export `db` and `analytics`
- `src/game/api.js` — `submitScore(entry)`, `fetchLeaderboard(limit=20)`
- Leaderboard screen fetches global scores on mount; falls back to local if offline
- Player name persisted locally (`numknight_player_name`) so they don't re-enter it each run
- Submit score at end of run (fire-and-forget, non-blocking)

### Considerations
- Offline-first: always save locally, submit globally when possible
- No login/accounts — name is the identity. Same name from different devices = separate entries (by design, keeps it simple)
- Names: client-side length cap (16 chars)

---

## Phase 7 — Per-Number Statistics ⏳ PENDING

**Goal:** Track each player's accuracy and response speed per multiplication table (×1–×9), show a statistics screen, and surface a color-coded "rating" on the practice number picker as a practice recommendation. Stats do NOT affect question selection in any mode.

### localStorage key: `numknight_stats`
```js
{
  players: [
    {
      name: "Alice",
      lastUsed: 1700000000000,   // timestamp — evict oldest when > 5 players
      numbers: {
        "3": { results: [{ success: bool, timeMs: number }, ...] },  // max 40, rolling
        // "1"–"9"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### What counts
- **Success**: correct on the very first attempt
- **Failure**: wrong on first attempt, OR timer expired (campaign)
- **timeMs**: ms from question display to first interaction (or timer limit in ms for expiry)
- For question `a × b`: record the **same result** to both `numbers[a]` AND `numbers[b]` (skip duplicate if `a === b`)
- Both **practice** and **campaign** battles feed stats
- Aggregated by `playerName` — up to 5 names stored, oldest evicted

### Rating formula (per number)
```
pct      = successes / results.length
medianMs = median of all timeMs values
rating   = pct × 0.6  +  (1 − clamp(medianMs, 500, 4000) / 4000) × 0.4
```
Bands: `< 0.40` = Needs work (red), `0.40–0.69` = Getting there (amber), `≥ 0.70` = Strong (green).

### Stats screen (`StatsScreen.jsx`)
- Accessible from Start Screen (solid yellow button below HALL OF FAME)
- Kingdom scenery background
- 3×3 grid — each cell: number, success %, median time, color tint from rating band
- Cells with < 10 results show "not enough data" in a dimmed state

### Practice picker enhancement
Each number button gets a small colored dot (bottom-right corner) for red/amber/green rating.
No dot if < 5 results. Legend line below the grid explains the colors.

### Hidden response timer
Runs in both `PracticeBattleScreen` and `BattleScreen`. Starts when new question renders, stops on first tap. Timer-expiry in campaign = `success: false, timeMs: world.timer * 1000`.

### Key files
- `src/game/statsState.js` — `recordResult(name, a, b, success, timeMs)`, `loadPlayerStats(name)`, `computeNumberRating(results)`
- `src/screens/StatsScreen.jsx` — stats display
- Modified: `PracticeBattleScreen.jsx`, `BattleScreen.jsx`, `PracticePickerScreen.jsx`, `StartScreen.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `i18n.js`

Full implementation checklist in `PLAN_PENDING.md` § Phase 7.

## Suggested implementation order
```
Phase 1 (World Map)      ✅ Done
Phase 2 (Backgrounds)   ✅ Done
Phase 3 (Scoring)       ✅ Done
Phase 4 (Local LB)      ✅ Done
Phase 5 (Polish)        ← next up — do incrementally, high impact per effort
Phase 6 (Backend LB)    ← last, biggest lift
Phase 7 (Statistics)    ← good next candidate — enhances practice mode
```
